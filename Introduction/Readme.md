### Introduction

Arrays are a simple data structure for storing lots of similar items. They exist in all programming languages, and are used as the basis for most other data structures. On their own, Arrays can be used to solve many interesting problems. Arrays come up very often in interview problems, and so being a guru with them is a must!

In this Explore Card, we'll introduce Arrays and solve some cool problems with them. This Card is beginner friendly, and we've provided lots of code snippets in Java to help you understand. Each topic begins with informative articles, followed by real interview problems for you to practice on.

In addition, the problems have hints which will help you in building up ideas on how to solve them. These hints will be subtle enough to set you on a particular path for reaching the optimized solution, without giving away the answer too easily.
