Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

```
Example 1:

Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Example 2:

Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]


Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
